 # An open source guide to Exercism
A project devoted to sharing solutions for problems from https://exercism.io

 ## Objective
We aim to collect and display solutions to the problems on Exercism in an organised easily navigatable format. Help us fulfill our objectives by contributing your solutions to this repo and sharing this project with your fellow Exercists :smile:

 ## Getting started
* This repository is organised into folders based on the language path available and then by the levels and the problems available.
* There is also a folder Contributors with separate files for listing the contributors in each language.

 ## How to contribute
* Please search the appropriate language and level folder to see if any solutions have been posted for the problem.
* If there are solutions already posted on the repository, please do review them to make sure you are not submitting a duplicate solution.
* Fork the repository and make the additions or changes you deem fit to it and create a request to merge the changes.
* We will review the changes and merge the request adding you onto the list of contributors to the page.
* We thank you in advance for your interest in this project
